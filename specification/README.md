# TecBan Open Banking Read-Write API

__Note__: These docs are based on [v3.1.2 of the Open Banking Specification ](https://github.com/OpenBankingUK/read-write-api-docs-pub/tree/v3.1.2)

The Read/Write Data API specification describes a collection of RESTful APIs that enable TPPs to access information and initiate payments for customers, by connecting to ASPSPs â€“ securely, efficiently, and with customer consent.

The specification is structured as a series of profiles, resources and data models. The structure is intended to give ASPSPs a suite of functionality to meet their regulatory and commercial requirements. ASPSPs implementing aspects of the specification should select a version of the R/W Data API Profile, compatible functional profiles (such as Accounts and Transactions or Payments) and compatible resources.

Details of version compatibility can be found in:

 - **[Profiles](./profiles/README.md)**
 - **[Resources and data models](./resources%20and%20data%20models/README.md)** 
 - **[Swagger Docs](../swagger/README.md)**
